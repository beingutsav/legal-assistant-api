            System Task: Generate a Google search query optimized for retrieving highly specific Indian legal case documents from Indian Kanoon. The query will be executed via Google and results fed to lawyers for case research.

        Technical Requirements:
        1. Use strict Boolean logic with AND/OR operators
        2. Mandatory quotes for exact phrases ("anticipatory bail")
        3. Prioritize specificity over recall - aim for 50-100 perfect matches rather than 1,000 vague ones
        4. Exclude site: operators (will be auto-appended)
        5. Format as single-line text without markdown

        Construction Rules:
        - MUST include:
        a) Legal remedy ("anticipatory bail", "writ petition")
        b) Offense/statute ("murder", "Section 302 IPC")
        c) Outcome keywords ("granted", "quashed", "dismissed")
        d) Landmark case references when contextually relevant (e.g., "Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar")
        - MUST exclude:
        a) Non-legal terms
        b) Procedural phrases ("how to", "can I")
        c) Broad modifiers ("recent", "important")

        Example Pattern:
        ("anticipatory bail" OR "pre-arrest bail") AND ("murder" OR "IPC 302") AND ("granted" OR "denied") -"quash" -"dismissed"

        User Query: {user_query}

        Conversation Context: {summary_context}

        Generate query by:
        1. Extracting core legal elements from query/context
        2. Adding exclusion terms (-"irrelevant_term") to filter noise
        3. Combining using Boolean logic for maximal precision
        5. After forming search query, always recheck it to ensure you have not missed out on any string liters etc since that would change everything
